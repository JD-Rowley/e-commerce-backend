  ## Description
  This is a working backend for an E-Commerce website. There are is no front-end so all tests were conducted in Insomnia core. There are routes for item Categories, Products, and Product Tags. Each of these routes have a GET all, GET one, POST, PUT, and DELETE route.
  ## Installation
  The user should make sure the node package manager (npm) is installed. Once that is done, the user should run the command 'npm i' or 'npm install' to install the dependencies.
  ## Usage
  Once the dependencies are installed, the user must login to mySQL and enter the command 'source db/schema.sql' to create the database. Then they must quit mySQL, and run the command 'npm run seed' to seed the database with data. Once this is complete, the user simply needs to enter the command 'npm start' to start the server and test in Insomnia Core.
